# JS Fundamentals

## Steps to Demo

1. Lecture about what JavaScript is and why we use it, general programming terminology
2. Demo each section after presenting it in the lecture slides:
    1. Primitive Data Types
    2. Operators
    3. Variables, functions

Demonstrate the console in Chrome dev tools to show this code. Alternatively, you could use a sandbox like [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?js,console) and introduce the dev tools console afterwards.
